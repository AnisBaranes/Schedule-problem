Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) Problems
A mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem is one where some of the decision variables are constrained to be integer values (i.e. whole numbers such as -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.) at the optimal solution.  The use of integer variables greatly expands the scope of useful optimization problems that you can define and solve.

### Scheduling model
Given N employees and 12 shifts: 2 shifts per day (morning, evening) from Sunday to Thursday and one shift on Friday and Saturday. 
#### X_ij  â€“ employee i,shift j 
Each employee submits his shift's preferences to the supervisor, if he doesn't want to work in some shift he need to give the reason. 
The supervisor prioritized the employee requests from 1 to 5 (lowest to top). This is the first line in the input file. The second line is the number of needed employees in each shift.
